* I had struggled quite a bit with this assignment as tailwind was new and confusing but i believe i got it all working properly, i found tailwind kind of interenting because it kind of sets up little things inside the folders which made it easier in my opinion to customize everything because it was all linked inside the project and you just had to use the right script to get it 
* I added everything that needed to be added and changed the font size, size and colours as well as changed the photo sizes to make it more custom
* i used all the resources provided  on the orginal page ( will be linked below )
